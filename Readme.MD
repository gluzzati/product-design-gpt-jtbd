# Product Design Automation with Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) and GPT

The Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework is a methodology centered around the concept that customers "hire" products or services to get specific jobs done. With this project, we leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to automate user interviews, generate JBTD jobs, outcomes, and job stories, thus driving your product roadmap more efficiently.

## What is this project about?

This project aims to expedite and streamline the process of understanding customer needs and experiences using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. By automating user interviews and generating job stories, we reduce the time and resources spent on extensive manual interactions, thereby optimizing data collection and product roadmap creation.

## How does it work?

1. **Synthesis of personas**: The system creates dynamic representations of user archetypes, complete with an understanding of their needs, goals, and pain points.
   
2. **Automated interviews**: We employ the language generation abilities of GPT-3.5 to create a dialogue system based on the JTBD framework. This system interacts with the synthetic personas, efficiently extracting key insights about customer motivations and needs.
   
3. **Outcomes and job stories generation**: Using the data collected from the automated interviews, the system generates outcomes and job stories that can inform and drive your product roadmap.

## Getting Started

To start using the system, clone the repository from the provided link: [marcocello/product-design-gpt-jtbd](https://github.com/marcocello/product-design-gpt-jtbd)

## Current Limitations

The current release (0.1) uses only GPT without any custom knowledge base and it generates up to the outcomes. Furthermore, the prompts used for generating jobs map and outcomes could benefit from additional refinement.
